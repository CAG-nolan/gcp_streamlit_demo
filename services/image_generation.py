This service will generate images based on the data that is fed to it. These images will be in three formats - these being:
1. An image of the food item in a consumer-ready package (i.e. pudding cup, frozen cup, etc.)
2. An image of the food item without a package, such that it appears to be a standalone food item.
3. An image of the packaging that the food can be in (such as a box of items or a bag of items).

Once these are created, they are served back to the frontend application to be displayed on the streamlit side.
